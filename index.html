		<h3>Adventure Game. By Jonathan Charleston</h3>
		<p>I built a Text based adventure game for DT and realised halfway through how grossly I had underestimated hard-coders. However, I pressed on and made a 5% finished project. maybe not make a game from nothing next time. The program used was a simple text editor and the code was built from scratch. It was a tough and arduous project and unfortunately it was never finished, however that was not the point and I believe that the target of learning enough C++ to get around and understand the functions was reached.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>When I started building the game, I had a clear story in mind. However, that story quickly deteriorated into a complete mess of characters and backstory. Even though that wasn't the point of the assignment I was still a little dissapointed at my clear lack of story building skill.
